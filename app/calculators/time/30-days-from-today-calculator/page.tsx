      q: "How many months is 30 days?",

    },
    {
      q: "Can I use a starting date other than today?",

      q: "Does the calculation include today?",
      a: `No. The count starts from the day after the start date. So "30 days from today" means 30 full days counted starting tomorrow.`,

            &quot;30 Days&quot; as a Stand-In for &quot;One Month&quot;
          </h2>
          <p className="text-gray-200 leading-relaxed text-base mb-4">
            Not every month is 30 days. Some months are like that (April,
            June, September, November), some have 31 days, and February has
            28 days or 29 in a leap year. People, in English speaking
            countries, often use &quot;30 days&quot; to mean &quot;one month&quot; so much
            that it&apos;s almost part of how contracts are written, how return
            policies are set, and how people talk in everyday life.
          </p>
          <p className="text-gray-200 leading-relaxed text-base">
            This causes real friction. A &quot;30-day money-back guarantee&quot;
            starting on August 9 doesn&apos;t expire &quot;next month&quot; in the loose
            sense — it expires on the specific date September 8, which is
            one day <em>before</em> the one-month calendar anniversary of
            September 9. That one-day gap is exactly the kind of thing
            companies rely on, whether intentionally or not, when a
            customer shows up a day late for a refund and gets turned away.

            Return and Refund Windows
          </h2>
          <p className="text-gray-200 leading-relaxed text-base">
            Thirty days is the most common return window for general
            retail, more generous than the 14-day windows often used for
            electronics, but shorter than the 60- or 90-day windows some
            higher-end retailers offer as a selling point. The trap here is
            the same as the money-back guarantee example above: &quot;30 days&quot;
            from your purchase date is not the same as &quot;the end of next
            month,&quot; and stores count from the actual transaction date on
            your receipt, not from when you decided to search for the
            return policy.

            Fitness and Habit Challenges
          </h2>
          <p className="text-gray-200 leading-relaxed text-base mb-4">
            &quot;30-day challenge&quot; content is everywhere — 30 days of no
            sugar, 30 days of daily workouts, 30-day squat challenges. The
            appeal is obvious: it maps cleanly onto &quot;a month,&quot; it&apos;s long
            enough to feel like a real commitment, and it&apos;s short enough
            to seem achievable.
          </p>
          <p className="text-gray-200 leading-relaxed text-base">
            Worth repeating the same caveat as with the 21-day habit myth:
            actual habit formation research suggests most habits take
            longer than a month to feel automatic, closer to two months on
            average. A 30-day challenge is a good structure for building
            initial momentum — just don&apos;t expect the habit to run on
            autopilot the day the challenge ends.

            Calendar Days vs. Business Days
          </h2>
          <p className="text-gray-200 leading-relaxed text-base">
            This distinction matters as much here as anywhere. &quot;30 days&quot;
            almost always means calendar days unless a document
            specifically says otherwise. &quot;30 business days,&quot; by contrast,
            skips every weekend in between and stretches out to roughly six
            calendar weeks — around 42 calendar days depending on
            holidays. Government processing times, in particular, love to
            quote business days without emphasizing the word &quot;business,&quot;
            which makes a six-week wait sound like a month.
